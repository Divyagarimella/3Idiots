## Welcome to 3Idiots

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. 
This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” 
### Markdown
